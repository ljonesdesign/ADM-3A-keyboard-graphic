When I first starting learning vim, I was very frustrated by having to reach so far up to the escape key switch modes. This did not make sense because vim was supposed to be crafted for efficiency. I understood why using the hjkl keys was better than using the arrow keys. So one day I discovered an old photo of the ADM-3A terminal, and I created this graphic in Adobe Illustrator.
